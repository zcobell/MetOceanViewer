Warning
-------

As of 2012, particularly with the issuance of C++11, these coding conventions
have become problematically obsolete in some areas.  Annotations are
indicated with >>.

Preface
-------

These coding conventions exist in the following context, the world as
it is in late 2006:

1.  The current version of standard C++ is ISO/IEC 14882:2003.
      >> Now it's ISO/IEC 14882:2011.

2.  Slackware Linux is shipping GCC 3.4.6 as its default compiler.
The current version of GCC is 4.1.1.  GCC 4.1 includes most or all of
the nonbinding TR1 ("Technical Report 1") extensions to ISO/IEC
14882:2003.  GCC 3.4.6 doesn't.
      >> XTide 2.13 requires GCC version 4.4 or newer.
      >> Older versions might work again with 2.13.1 but not tested.

3.  TR1 adds shared_ptr, tuples, and unordered associative containers
(a.k.a. hash-maps), but nothing else of particular relevance to XTide
2.9.  The only significant use of shared_ptr in XTide would be as a
workaround for the inability to store auto_ptrs in STL containers.
This application of shared_ptr would in turn be obsoleted by the Boost
pointer container library, which solves the problem more elegantly.
      >> Fixed in C++11.

4.  The current version of the Boost C++ Libraries is 1.33.1 (December
2005).  The Boost libraries contain many extensions not included in
TR1.  The pointer container library would be applicable in XTide 2.9
to eliminate most remaining cases of explicit memory management.
Boost's date_time library has some overlap with XTide's temporal
classes but is not a substitute for them.

As much as practical, XTide deliberately refrains from depending upon
any extensions to ISO/IEC 14882:2003 (even those built into GCC) and
minimizes its dependencies on external packages that would need to be
installed.  Following are the only extensions known to be used in the
default configuration.

- The long long int data type, without which it is impractical to
handle times outside of the 1970-2037 epoch.
      >> No longer an extension in C++11.

- The #warning preprocessor directive.  If not supported, the warnings
become errors, which is OK.
      >> Not OK; had to work around for Visual C++.

- The SCNx8 (probably "hhx") scanf format macro, without which the
code for parsing RGB color specifications is intolerably obfuscated.
      >> Not OK; caused a memory corruption error in Visual C++.

>> XTide 2.13 uses extended initializer lists, which are new in C++11.
>> Made optional in XTide 2.13.1 due to continued Visual C++ non-support.


XTide Cleanup2006 coding conventions
------------------------------------

I.  Conformance

  1.  Adherence to coding conventions is more important for public
  methods, functions and variables than for protected methods and
  variables.

  2.  Adherence to coding conventions is more important for protected
  methods and variables than for functions and variables with static
  or local visibility.

  3.  Adherence to coding conventions is least important for the
  internals of third-party code and incorporated legacy code.

II.  Naming

  1.  The names of classes, namespaces, and enums begin with a capital
  letter.  The names of methods, functions, variables, and enum values
  begin with a lowercase letter.  To distinguish words within names,
  CamelCase is preferred.

    1a.  Exception:  If a name contains within it a proper name or
    acronym, fudge as needed to preserve the correct capitalization
    (e.g., print_iCalendar instead of printIcalendar).

    1b.  Exception:  To avoid clashes with names defined by X11, all
    X11-related classes shall be prefixed by "xx" in lieu of "X".

  2.  If a public name clashes with a protected name, the protected
  name shall be prefixed by an underscore.

  3.  If a public parameter name clashes with a public variable, the
  parameter name shall be suffixed by an underscore.

  4.  If a parameter is used only to contain a return value and its
  value on invocation is irrelevant, its name may be suffixed by _out
  to clarify this behavior.

  5.  Scalar typedefs either shall be named something_t consistent
  with the libc convention or shall begin with a lowercase letter and
  use CamelCase.  Typedefs of classes shall begin with a capital
  letter and use CamelCase.

  6.  Where XTide code interfaces with third-party and/or legacy code
  that does not adhere to these conventions, naming shall adhere to
  the principle of least astonishment.

III.  Parameter passing protocol

  1.  Instances of simple structs and classes that behave like scalar
  values may be passed by value.  Examples include Amplitude, Angle,
  CurrentBearing, Date, Interval, NullableInterval,
  NullablePredictionValue, PredictionValue, Speed, Timestamp and Year.

  2.  Other structs and classes should be passed by const reference or
  pointer unless a value is specifically needed.

  3.  When there are multiple returns and no particular reason to
  choose any one of them over any other to be the return value,
  declare the method void and use _out parameters for all returns.  If
  there is one that deserves to be the return value above all others
  it is probably a status indicator (success or failure).

  4.  _out parameters should be at the beginning or end of the
  parameter list, not buried in the middle.

IV.  Visibility

  1.  XTide is largely maintained by a single author.  Consequently,
  it is not necessary to prevent every possible misuse of a class.
  Full accessorization to protect class variables from external
  modification is done where convenient and where extra protection is
  warranted, but need not be done in cases where it would merely
  produce more code.

  2.  Methods that do not depend on the state of an instance in any
  way should instead be functions, preferably static functions.

  3.  Global variables, functions, and enums should be declared within
  a namespace.

    3a.  Exception:  Data type operators like < and ==.
      >> And similar overloaded operations like stringWidth.

    3b.  Exception:  Variables and functions that must be in the
    default namespace for integration with third-party and legacy
    code.

      >> When libxtide was split off in XTide 2.14 it took ownership of the
      >> Global namespace and it no longer made sense for the few things in
      >> xxGlobal to be merged into that.

  4.  Do not define meaningless classes just to avoid having global
  variables and functions.  It just creates extra code to always have
  an instance of that class around.

V.  Choice of scalar data types

  1.  Float is considered harmful because problems caused by
  inadequate precision are difficult to diagnose.  Always use double.

  2.  For general use, default word length integers (int and unsigned
  int) are preferred, even if a shorter integer type would suffice.
  (Note:  At some point in the future, this usage might migrate to
  int_fastX_t.  For now, it is assumed that plain old ints are more
  portable.)

  3.  In contexts where 16 bits might be insufficient, long ints
  should be used.  (Note:  At some point in the future, this usage
  might migrate to int_fast32_t.  For now, it is assumed that plain
  old long ints are more portable.)

  4.  Variables that should never hold a negative value (i.e., most
  counters and indices) should be declared unsigned if possible.

    4a.  Exception:  Unsigned values should not be used in cases where
    losing the sign would mask a failure.

    4b.  Exception:  Unsigned values should not be used if it would
    necessitate a special case for 0 (e.g., if logic within a loop
    refers to element i-1).

    4c.  Exception:  When interfacing with external functions that use
    signed values for no apparent reason, signed values may be used
    consistently to avoid mixed-mode computation.

  5.  For consistency with libc, char is preferred to either signed or
  unsigned char when working with text.
      >> Mistake!  char should be unsigned.

VI.  Choice of nonscalar data types

  1.  All homebrew data structures that involve some kind of
  self-referential node (linked lists, trees, and every possible
  variant) should be reimplemented using standard templates.

  2.  "Spaghetti monster" data structures for which there is no
  standard substitute should be refactored.  Usually they are trying
  to do several jobs at once that would be more cleanly performed by
  several separate data structures.

  3.  Use of the Standard Template Library is encouraged in general,
  but exceptions are noted below.

  4.  std::vector implements dangerous, unchecked C-language semantics
  on operator [].  Use SafeVector instead.

     The at() method throws std::out_of_range if index >= size().  It
     does not appear in the venerable and freely available SGI
     Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide (1994?), but it's
     there in ISO/IEC 14882:1998, supplementing rather than replacing
     the dangerous unchecked operator[].

     IMO there is no good reason for operator[] to be unsafe and thus
     no reason for at().  If you want C, you know where to find it.

      >> SafeVector should delegate to at().

  5.  Never use std::string.  Always use Dstr, or (in rare cases)
  SafeVector<char>.

  6.  std::map is problematic because there is no const [] operator.
  Use BetterMap instead.

     The STL included with g++ 4.1.0 provides an at() method in both
     const and non-const versions that throws std::out_of_range if the
     key is not matched.  However, at() is not in ISO/IEC 14882:2003
     and it's not in the STL provided with g++ 3.4.6.

VII.  #defines

  1.  #defines are a fact of life in a C/C++ environment.  Standard
  headers are already full of them.  Nevertheless, the addition of new
  #defines should be approached with caution.

  2.  #defines do have their uses.

    2a.  #defines are an appropriate mechanism to receive input from
    the configure script, including versioning information and
    --enable-X and --with-X configure options.

    2b.  #defines of actual code macros, as opposed to constant
    values, are occasionally useful to condense overly wordy or
    repetitive code.

    2c.  It is sometimes necessary to use a #define instead of a const
    variable because the value is needed at compile time.  Const
    variables can't be initialized in a header file unless they are of
    integral or enumeration type.  #defines can expand to literals of
    any type and can even be stringified (turned into string literals)
    at compile time.

    2d.  The typelessness of #defines is occasionally useful when it
    is desirable to apply the default literal typing rules in
    different contexts.

  3.  In other cases, const variables are generally preferable.

  4.  Global #defines should not use short names that are liable to
  collide with other names throughout the program.

VIII.  Coding practices

  1.  Use const.

    1a.  For input parameters, err or the side of constness.

    1b.  For return values that are pointers or references, err on the
    side of mutability.  Returning const references everywhere
    complicates integration with standard library functions whose
    parameters should be declared const but aren't.  As XTide is
    largely maintained by a single author, the risk of improper access
    to private class variables is not worrisome.

    1c.  For return values that are just values, use const.  This rule
    requires extended explanation; see the Appendix below.

    1d.  A method that changes the state of an instance is not const,
    even if said changes are completely invisible outside of the
    instance.

    1e.  Be aware that each level of indirection might require another
    const.  E.g., char const * const * const argv is not unreasonable.

  2.  Never cast away const.
      >> Except when passing character strings to legacy libraries that are
      >> never going to fix their APIs.  The compiler warnings have nagged me
      >> to death.

  3.  Namespaces should be specified explicitly, never "use"d, because
  qualifiers like Global:: and Error:: are an aid to understanding.
      >> Impractical not to use namespace libxtide.

  4.  Prefix ++ and -- are preferred to postfix ++ and -- because the
  postfix operators are believed to create unnecessary temporaries.

  5.  Explicit memory management (especially the need to free and
  delete things) should be avoided as much as possible.

    5a.  Never new or malloc an array when you can use an auto
    SafeVector instead.  ISO 14882:2003 Section 23.2.4 states that the
    elements of a vector are stored contiguously, so in a pinch they
    are convertible to C arrays.

    5b.  Use std::auto_ptr where appropriate to handle deletion of
    objects that are allocated with "new."  (It's no good for arrays.)
      >> auto_ptr is now deprecated, but is not going to disappear from XTide
      >> any time soon.

    5c.  Exception:  Currently there is no good way to manage
    collections of non-assignable objects.  Standardization of
    something equivalent to the Boost pointer container library will
    solve this issue.
      >> Fixed in C++11.

    5d.  Exception:  Currently there is no good way to manage char**
    constructs expected by legacy library functions.

  6.  Don't make all operators return a reference to "this" just
  because that's what everyone always does.  If the references are
  never used, let the operators return void.

  7.  Parameters for which the supplied value is always the same
  global variable should be eliminated.

  8.  Temporaries and implicit conversions are not necessarily evil;
  i.e., it is not always necessary to provide a method that works on
  const char* if you already have a reasonably efficient one that
  takes const Dstr&.

  9.  Where there is the temptation to create an improper inheritance
  relationship, implicit conversion should be used instead.

  10.  Never use C++ streams.  Use only C I/O.  (This rule would be
  inappropriate for many applications, but XTide has been implemented
  with streams and without, and it was simpler to get the desired
  results from printf than from <<.  Moreover, the original streams
  library got deprecated soon after I built to it.)

  11.  Use of "friend" should be minimized.

  12.  STL algorithms and the associated infrastructure of functors,
  adaptors, and so on have many productive uses, but replacing every
  simple for-loop with an algorithm call isn't one of them.  Function
  objects are obfuscatory--a price worth paying in those cases where
  an STL algorithm is really needed, but needless overhead where a
  simple for-loop would do.  This issue goes away when you add lambda
  functions, but standard C++ doesn't have those yet.  (Boost does.)

IX.  Formatting

  1.  Styling and formatting shall be automated as soon as somebody
  writes a version of GNU indent that does something reasonable with
  C++.

  2.  Until then,
    2a.  Brace style is K&R with the exception that opening function
         braces are not placed on a separate line.
    2b.  Indentation is by 2 characters.
    2c.  Nominal line length is 80 characters.
    2d.  Two blank lines between function and method definitions.

X.  Grandfathered legacy code

  1.  Values of Error::TideError are all capital letters with
  underscores between words.  (These were originally patterned after
  VAX/VMS error codes.)

  2.  The XML parser uses nonstandard data structures.  In fact the
  XML parser has no right to exist since XML parsing libraries are now
  ubiquitous.

  3.  Dstr is shared by many projects and it will not be changing just
  for XTide's coding conventions.

  4.  Skycal and wvsrtv are large chunks of third-party code and I'm
  not going to rewrite them.

XI.  Optimization

  1.  Optimization comes last.

  2.  Do not create inline methods during development.  Wait until the
  end, do a performance profile, and then (and only then) inline
  *only* those methods that are truly getting hammered.  (N.B., in
  some cases, circular header file dependencies can make inlining
  impossible.)
      >> Link-time optimization is a game-changer.

  3.  Optimizing header file inclusions to speed up compiles is a nice
  concept, but if you have more than a few circular dependencies it's
  a waste of time to even try.


Appendix:  Why Return Values Are Const
--------------------------------------

Rule VIII.1c papers over an astonishing inconsistency in the C++
language.  Consider the following program, which gets its result
through the dubious process of modifying a temporary.

  Year currentYear () { return 2007; }

  int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    printf ("Next year is %u\n", unsigned(++currentYear()));
    return 0;
  }

If Year is defined as a builtin type (as below), the program will not
compile.

  typedef unsigned Year;
  // Results in "error: non-lvalue in increment"

However, if Year is instead a class with equivalent behavior (as
below), the program will compile, run, and give the expected output of
2008.

  class Year {
  public:
    Year (unsigned year): _year(year)  {}
    operator unsigned ()               { return _year; }
    Year operator++ ()                 { ++_year; return *this; }
  protected:
    unsigned _year;
  };

It hardly ever makes sense to modify a temporary.  Declaring return
values const prevents it.  Unfortunately, consting return values is
sure to confuse the reader regardless how it is implemented.

If return values are made const only when the underlying type is a
class, the resulting interface looks wrong.

  typedef double Multiplier;
  [...]

  const Interval        timeAdd()       const;
  const PredictionValue levelAdd()      const;
  Multiplier            levelMultiply() const;
  // ^^^  Multipliers are mutable, but the others are not???

OTOH, consting returns that use builtin types causes astonishment in
those cases where there are no object-returning methods nearby for
comparison.

  virtual const bool isBanner() const;
  //      ^^^^^   Pointless!  What idiot wrote this?

XTide 2.9 follows the liberal approach and uses const even in those
cases where it is redundant.  The consting of builtin return types
will initially astonish the reader, but a consistent rule simplifies
maintenance.  E.g., one need not change the signatures of methods all
over the place when the underlying representation of Year changes from
object to unsigned or vice-versa.
